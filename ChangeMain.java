/**
 * Write a program that determines the change to be dispensed from a vending 
 * machine. An item in the machine can cost between 25 cents and 1 dollar, in 5-cent
 * increments (25, 30, 35, . . . , 90, 95, or 100), and the machine accepts only a 
 * single dollar bill to pay for the item. For example, a possible sample dialogue
 * might be the following:
 * Enter price of item (from 25 cents to a dollar, in 5-cent increments): 45
 * You bought an item for 45 cents and gave me a dollar, so your change is 
 * 2 quarters, 0 dimes, and 1 nickels.
